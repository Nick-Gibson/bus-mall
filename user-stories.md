#Bus Mall Marketing Survey user stories

##As A user...

As a user, I want a fun experience, so I'll be more willing to complete the survery.

As a user, I want clear instructions, so I know what to do.

As a user, I want the site to actually work as the instructions state, so I don't get needlessly frustrated.

As a user, I want the site to be quick and responsive, so I don't get distracted/frustrated and click away.

##As A Developer...

As a developer, I want the code to be clean and DRY so that I can continue to work on it quickly and easily in future labs.

As a developer/student, I want to showcase my skills by completing all the technical requirements requested.

As a developer, I want to include a kind of input validation so stray clicks aren't included in the final calculations.

As a developer, I want to constrain image sizes and be wary of file types to avoid rendering errors in the final product.

##As A Marketing Analyst...

As a marketing analyst, I want users to be encouraged to complete the survey so we get good data.

As a marketing analyst, I want the totals from the user survey to auto-generate, to make them more useful, readable, and time-efficient.

As a marketing analyst, I want to use this information to make *as much money as humanely possible*. How much money? *All the money. ALL of it. Seriously, if people lose their %^&$@^! homes because they spend all their money on Bus Mall products, I'm entirely okay with that. I'm talking Bezos, Ballmer, Branson levels of cash -- 'Bus Mall' will be the fourth B in that array, baby!*

As a marketing analyst, I want the relative desirability of products to be clear, so our products included in the catalogue can be data-driven.
